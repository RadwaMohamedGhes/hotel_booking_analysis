# hotel_booking_analysis
The dataset includes information about hotel bookings and if there were cancellations, arrival year, arrival month, arrival day, market segment, duration of stay in weekends and weeks, and other helpful information.
I made my analysis and created dashboards that give many insights using Excel. 
I wrote my insights and recommendations in a Word file.
